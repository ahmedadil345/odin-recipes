This project is an amazing opportunity to practice HTML and Git! I created a fantastic recipe website using only HTML, without any styling (for now). I mainly used basic HTML elements such as '<p></p>', '<ol></ol>', '<ul></ul>', '<img>', and '<a></a>' along with some tags such as "lang='', charset='', href='', and src=''. I was also able to use basic commands such as add, commit, status, log and push with ease and comfort.
